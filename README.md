# Netviz

## Motivation

Ten years ago Netflix was only present in the United States. Nowadays, the world-wide streaming platform is available in more than 190 countries. Its catalogue is rapidly growing not only to catch up with recent movies and TV shows releases, but also to adapt their content to the local market by producing original content.

They gradually made their services available in different parts of the world, which in turn created demand and introduced new kinds of viewers. Doing so allowed the company to update their business model. On the one hand, they started collaborating with local studios offering new original content. On the other hand, they made available existing local content to their global audience.

We expect that the evolution of their library reflects this strategy. We are therefore interested in studying how Netflix's release strategy evolved during the last decade.

## Context

This project has be carried out in the scope of a data visualization class at EPFL. It was divided into multiple milestones. 

- In the [first milestone](milestones/milestone1.md), we defined our project, scraped the data, and then performed an [exploratory data analysis](milestones/eda.md).
- In the [second milestone](milestones/milestone2.md), we sketched the website and the visualizations in detail.
- In the final milestone, we built the final product and wrote the [process book](milestones/ProcessBook.pdf).

The final product is available [here](karimassi.github.io/netviz). For a better experience, we recommend using Google Chrome or Edge from a computer to browse it. This ensures a smoother and more enjoyable experience. We recorded a screecast showcasing our website and its scenario and it's available [here](https://youtu.be/-1IZJbK5wSM).
